# =============================================================================
# DOCKER COMPOSE CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
#
# Orchestrates the Reach Publishers Book Editor application.
# This is the recommended way to run the application in production.
#
# USAGE:
# ------
# Build and start:
#   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxx
#   docker compose up --build -d
#
# View logs:
#   docker compose logs -f
#
# Stop:
#   docker compose down
#
# Rebuild after code changes:
#   docker compose build && docker compose up -d
#
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
# ----------------------
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Required - Your Anthropic API key (starts with sk-ant-)
#                    Set before running: export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx
#                    If not set, the server will start but editing will fail.
#
# NODE_ENV: production (set in compose file)
# PORT: 3001 (internal port, set in compose file)
#
# PORT MAPPING:
# -------------
# External: 3002 (access the app at http://localhost:3002 or http://your-vps-ip:3002)
# Internal: 3001 (inside the container)
#
# The mapping "3002:3001" means:
# - Host port 3002 → Container port 3001
# - Access the app via port 3002 on the host machine
#
# HEALTH CHECK:
# -------------
# After starting, verify the app is running:
#   curl http://localhost:3002/health
#
# Expected response:
#   {"status":"ok","message":"Book Editor Backend is running","apiKeyConfigured":true}
#
# If apiKeyConfigured is false, check your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable.
#
# RESTART POLICY:
# ---------------
# "unless-stopped" means the container will automatically restart:
# - After a crash
# - After Docker daemon restart
# - After server reboot
# But NOT if you manually stop it with "docker compose down"
#
# HOSTINGER VPS DEPLOYMENT:
# -------------------------
# 1. SSH into your VPS
# 2. cd /home/user/book-editor
# 3. export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxx
# 4. docker compose build
# 5. docker compose up -d
# 6. Test: curl http://localhost:3002/health
#
# To make the API key persist across reboots, add to ~/.bashrc:
#   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxx
#
